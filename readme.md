# RAG Application with Streamlit

## Overview
This is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system built with Streamlit. It leverages **OpenAI GPT models**, FAISS for vector-based document search, and Neo4j for graph-based metadata exploration. The application enables efficient question-answering and document metadata extraction for uploaded text files.

## Features
- **Question Answering**: Combines semantic search with retrieval-augmented generation.
- **Document Metadata Extraction**: Extracts and summarizes key information like title, author, and themes.
- **Graph Integration**: Queries metadata using Neo4j for enhanced insights.
- **Customizable Chunking**: Supports dynamic or pre-defined text chunking for efficient processing.
